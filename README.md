Implementation HMM 

The code  complete the two aspect problem of the HMM:
  
  * evaluate:evaluate the probability fo the observation sequences undser the HMM model     
  * decode:cal the most probable hidden states sequence to the observation sequcences.   
  
I use forward algorithm to solve the evluate problem and the viterbi algorithm for the second one.you can find it in the hmm.py

I set the initial infomation in the example.py.
